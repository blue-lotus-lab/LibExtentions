## Exploring Future Solutions for Efficient Cryptocurrency Swaps

### Abstract:
Cryptocurrency swaps have gained significant popularity in recent years, providing users with a convenient and decentralized method to exchange digital assets. However, existing swap platforms often suffer from inefficiencies, particularly in terms of gas fees incurred during unnecessary transactions. This paper proposes a comprehensive solution to address these challenges by combining the utilization of signature, NFT standards, and the implementation of the "permit ERC20" mechanism. Furthermore, it explores the potential benefits of employing ERC721 and ERC1155 standards to enhance the overall efficiency and user experience of cryptocurrency swaps.

#### Introduction
Cryptocurrency swaps have revolutionized the way individuals transact and exchange digital assets. However, the current landscape of swap platforms presents certain inefficiencies, particularly concerning the excessive gas fees incurred during unnecessary transactions. This paper aims to present a solution that tackles these challenges by leveraging signature authentication, NFT standards, and the implementation of the "permit ERC20" mechanism.

#### The "Permit ERC20" Mechanism
The first proposed solution involves the utilization of the "permit ERC20" mechanism. This mechanism enables users to sign messages without incurring gas fees, facilitating the transfer of native tokens. By implementing "permit ERC20," users can swap tokens, such as TokenA to TokenB, by paying only a single gas fee when TokenB is sent to the user's wallet address. This solution effectively reduces unnecessary gas fees associated with swap transactions.\
This permit ERC20 is the swap platform native token. In some cases can to use each pair wrapped token is/as a permit ERC20.

#### Leveraging NFT Standards (ERC721)
To address the issue of unnecessary transactions and enhance the stability of swap positions, the implementation of ERC721, a non-fungible token (NFT) standard, is proposed. By registering the position of trades/swaps using ERC721 tokens, users have two opportunities. Firstly, they can lock ERC20 tokens into ERC721, ensuring a stable position during the swap process. Secondly, users can execute swap transactions for two ERC20 pairs by minting and burning an ERC721 token. This solution streamlines the swap process and minimizes unnecessary transactions.

#### Harnessing the Power of ERC1155
Another solution to optimize cryptocurrency swaps involves the utilization of ERC1155 tokens. By leveraging ERC1155, users can create a unique ERC1155 smart contract, which serves as an aggregator for the swap platform. Users can mint ERC1155 tokens as pair tokens (e.g., TokenA and TokenB), providing a seamless and efficient method for swapping multiple ERC20 pairs. This solution reduces the need for multiple transactions and enhances the user experience on swap platforms.\
Swap platforms can to create an ERC1155 factory contract for each user, when user want to trade/swap can to have that.\
How to use: Simple, each ERC1155 ID'd referencing/representing an unique ERC20.

#### The Ultimate Solution: A Combination Approach
To achieve the highest level of efficiency and user experience, a combination of the aforementioned solutions is proposed. By integrating the "permit ERC20" mechanism, ERC721, and ERC1155 standards, swap platforms can offer a unique and robust solution. Users will benefit from reduced gas fees, stable swap positions, and the ability to swap multiple ERC20 pairs seamlessly. This comprehensive approach represents the future of efficient cryptocurrency swaps.\
Situations: For example combining EIP712 with EIP1271 for signatures on the combination solution. This is need to research and tests.

### Conclusion
Cryptocurrency swaps have become an integral part of the digital asset ecosystem. However, the existing inefficiencies associated with gas fees and unnecessary transactions pose significant challenges. This paper has presented a holistic approach to address these issues, combining the utilization of signature, NFT standards (ERC721), and the implementation of the "permit ERC20" mechanism. Furthermore, it has explored the potential benefits of leveraging ERC1155 tokens for enhanced swap functionality. By adopting these solutions, swap platforms can offer users a more efficient and seamless experience in the future.
